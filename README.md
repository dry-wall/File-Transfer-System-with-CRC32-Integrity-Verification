# File-Transfer-System-with-CRC32-Integrity-Verification
A multi-threaded client-server application written in C++ for transferring files over a TCP network. This project uses the Windows Sockets API (Winsock2) and includes data integrity verification using a CRC32 checksum to ensure files are not corrupted during transfer.
